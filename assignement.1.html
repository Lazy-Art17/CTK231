    <h1>School of Creative Technologies</h1> 

    <p><b>Address:</b> Campus Box 5750<br><b>Phone:</b>(309) 438-2875<br>
    <b>Director:</b>Colby Jennings Degrees<br><b>Degrees Offered:</b>B.A., B.S.</p>

    <h2>Major in Creative Technologies</h2>
    <p> The interdisciplinary Creative Technologies major emphasizes design and practice in the integration of digital technologies 
    and the fine arts.<br> In addition to foundational study across the fine arts, the major provides training and experiences across a 
    range of creative/technical fields including<br> video, sound, electronic music, music production, gaming, motion graphics, interactivity, 
    AR/VR, UI/UX, mobile, web, and computer programming<br> concepts.</p>

    <h3>Retention Requirements</h3

<ul>
  <li><b>Sequence in Audio and Music Production and Interdisciplinary Technologies</b> - Students will be allowed to continue in this 
sequence <i>if <br>  
they meet and continue to maintain an overall cumulative GPA of 2.50.</i></li>
  <li><b>Sequence in Game Design</b> - Students will be allowed to continue in this sequence if they meet and continue to maintain an 
    overall cumulative GPA of 2.50 and a cumulative <br> GPA of 3.0 within the major. Additionally, students in the Game Design Sequence 
    must maintain consecutive <br> Fallâ€“Spring enrollment in their final at the University. Any student not enrolled at the university for 
    more than one semester must reapply to <br> the sequence. Students who leave the Sequence in Game Design may continue as a Creative 
    Technologies major in Audio and Music <br> Production or Interdisciplinary Technologies if they have an overall cumulative GPA of 2.50.</li>
</ul>        	
 
<h3>Standards for Progress in the Major</h3>
<P> Students will be allowed to continue in the Creative Technologies program if they met and continue to maintain a 
    cumulative GPA of 2.50 and have <br> demonstrated competency through an intermediate portfolio review.</P>

<h3>Sequences in Creative Technologies</h3>
<p> <b>Accelerated Creative Technologies Sequence</b></p>
<p>High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion 
    of their <br> undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count 
    for both the undergraduate <br> and graduate program in Creative Technologies. Students can then apply to the Creative Technologies graduate 
    program in the spring of their senior <br> year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the 
    Creative Technologies graduate program. For additional <br> information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and 
    selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the Creative <br> Technologies Program advisor. </p>
