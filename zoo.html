<h1>Zoo</h1>
<img src="Zoo.gif" alt="Cool Panther" >
<p>The main focus is on the panther. The panther looks fierce and ready to strike. This seems to be used for a zoo, a zoo in brookfield.
    The background has some age to it. The panther seems to look like it was drawn by a tattoo artist.</p>
