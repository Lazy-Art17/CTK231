<h3>Sequences in Creative Technologies</h3>
<p> <b>Accelerated Creative Technologies Sequence</b></p>
<p>High achieving students with a cumulative GPA of 3.20 or higher may apply to the accelerated sequence one year before completion 
    of their <br> undergraduate degree. This sequence allows students to take up to 12 hours of approved graduate courses that will count 
    for both the undergraduate <br> and graduate program in Creative Technologies. Students can then apply to the Creative Technologies graduate 
    program in the spring of their senior <br> year. Enrollment in the Accelerated Sequence does not guarantee final admission into the 
    Creative Technologies graduate program. For additional <br> information on minimum requirements for admission and the application and 
    selection process, visit IllinoisState.edu/Majors and the Creative <br> Technologies Program advisor. </p>
